## CMake

To get started the easiest way is to add spud via CMake to your project.
It's as simple as adding the below lines to your `CMakeLists.txt`

```cmake
FetchContent_Declare(
      spud
      GIT_REPOSITORY "https://github.com/tashcan/spud.git"
      GIT_TAG origin/main
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(spud)
```

## xmake
